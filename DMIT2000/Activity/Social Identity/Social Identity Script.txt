Hi, I'm Seonhye Yoon.
This is my social identity diagram. I'll start from the top.

Family. I have a brother 9 years older than me, and I'm living with him now. my parents are in Korea, so I always miss them. I think I feel more precious after I live apart. um.. for me Family.. They will trust and support me in any situation, and that strengthens me.

I really like to listen or play music, and read books. When I was in high school, I did orchestra, that is one of the best experience in my life. and I really love read book. I have bad eyesight because I read[레드] books without turning on the lights when I was young.

Also Friends. Me and freinds almost lived at school. We went school at 8am, and left at 10pm. In fact we were always together except only for sleeping time. We used same classroom, studied same subjects, ate every meal and exercised together. The difference in personality is not the matter. We just know well each other, and just admit.

These are my social identity and thank you for listening.
