Thank you Julian

the first point is the transaction status. the financial department is in charge of it. The finance department records all transaction, also the transaction staus.

The next is the Loyalty, and points. The Sales department, and finance department manages it. 
The sales department gets involved in points when customers pay, for example can use the point or not, if is is available how many points can be redeemed. 
and the finance department has to check how many points redeemed. It is because the amount paid decreases by the redeemed points, so they need to make sure that it fits correctly.

and the Barcode. This is managed by the sales department. The whole information in receipt is included in barcode. So, The Sales department can find the details when they scan the barcode. it can be used when customers refund or change products.

Then I'll pass to Valeria.
